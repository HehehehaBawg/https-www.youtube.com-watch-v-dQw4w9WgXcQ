<h3>Basic Information</h3>
    <p> Good evening fellow person. Let's start out this website with a little knowledge of our religion. First, as you may have guessed, we are a religion based on the Nickelodeon producer Dan Schneider. Unfortunately he has cut ties with Nickelodeon recently though due to unknown circumstances. Keeping it pretty simple, we are a religion based on him. We have many rules, consequences, and demands that you must partake in or you shall be shunned by the Schneiderian community. Since this is basic information we shall not disclose any of those certain rules here but you may be able to find them in other tabs of our website.</p>
